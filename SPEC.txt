FF14 MISSING ELEMENTS:

In-game Calendar (think WoW)
Notes for MB prices.
RP layering (think MRP)

Add a value per time.

  Example: An item has HQ prices so close to the normal, so
  you want to know if mass crafting it is better than
  finding an item that has a higher profit but must be manually
  crafted.

1 mass craft (6.5sec~)

Speed Manual Craft (8secs~)
  - Manual, but rushing progress.
  - 1% quality
  - Fastest means to mass produce without failure
    while grinding the XP while leveling.

Paced Manual craft (12secs~)
   - Starter macro, but manual finish.
   - 20-100% quality

Expert Manual Craft (20 secs)
   - Entirely manual with high deviations
   - 40-100% quality
